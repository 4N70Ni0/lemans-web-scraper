This is a self-impose LeMans challenge to build a web-scraper of the data provided freely from LeMans at https://live.24h-lemans.com/en/live.
I have used Selenium to get the data and PyQt5 for the UI. I have also used QtDesigner for making the base UI.
I must say that although this is not the best piece of code, I had much fun doing it and I have learnt a lot. 
I am really tired, I have barely slept and maybe there are some nosense here or there :-)
Happy coding!

Zawsze na wyścigach czadu da za trzech
Robert Kubica cały świat zachwyca
Gdy po torach śmiga aż zapiera dech
